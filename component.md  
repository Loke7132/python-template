# Component Structure

## What is a Component?
A component in this template is a self-contained Python package that:
1. Lives under the `src/` directory
2. Has a single, well-defined responsibility
3. Exposes a clear public interface
4. Contains its own tests and documentation



### Structure

``` shell
src/
└── hello_world/
├── init.py # Public interface
├── main.py # Core implementation


```
